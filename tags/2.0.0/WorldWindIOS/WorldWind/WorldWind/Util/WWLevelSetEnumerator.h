/**
* WWLevelSetEnumerator is a subclass of NSEnumerator that enumerates the tiles in a WWLevelSet.
*
* Level set enumerators are not intended to be used directly, and when possible should be created through the methods
* defined in WWLevelSet. For example, [WWLevelSet tileEnumeratorForSector:] returns an enumerator object that lets the
* caller access each tile in the level set intersecting the specified sector.
*
* The caller sends nextObject repeatedly to a newly created WWLevelSetEnumerator to have it return a WWTileKey
* corresponding to the next tile in the level set. The WWTileKey instances returned by nextObject are mutable and must
* not be retained or modified by the caller. The enumerator traverses the tiles of level that intersect the specified
* sector in row-major order, starting with the specified first level and ending with the specified last level. If the
* first level and last level are the same, the enumerator traverses tiles in the first level. When the level set is
* exhausted, nil is returned. Callers cannot reset an enumerator after it has exhausted the tiles in its level set. To
* enumerate a collection again, create a new enumerator.
*
* Calls to nextObject should be wrapped in a local autorelease pool. Each call to nextObject results in an autoreleased
* object and the overhead of the autorelease information can be substantial when enumerating the tiles of a level set.
*
* This retains the level set during enumeration. When the enumeration is exhausted, the level set is released.
