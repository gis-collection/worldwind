/**
* Provides a layer that displays multi-resolution imagery arranged as adjacent tiles. This is the primary World
* Wind base class for displaying imagery of this type. While it may be used as a stand-alone class,
* it is typically subclassed by classes that identify the remote image server and the local cache path.
*
* By default this class retrieves images from a remote server and caches them in the local file system once retrieved.
* Thereafter the local versions are used.
*
* While the image tiles for this class are typically drawn from a remote server such as a WMS server. The actual
* retrieval protocol is independent of this class and encapsulated by a class implementing the WWUrlBuilder
* protocol and associated with instances of this class as a property.
*
* There is no requirement that image tiles of this class be remote, they may be local or procedurally generated. For
* such cases the subclass overrides this class' retrieveTileImage method.
*
* Image retrieval occurs on a separate thread from the event dispatch thread. See retrieveTilImage for more
* information.
*
* Layers of this type are not pickable. Their pick-enabled flag is initialized to NO and cannot be set to YES.
