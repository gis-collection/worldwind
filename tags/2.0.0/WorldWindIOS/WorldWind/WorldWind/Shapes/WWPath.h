/**
* Displays a line or curve between specified positions.
*
* The path is drawn between input positions to achieve a specified path type, one of WW_GREAT_CIRCLE, WW_RHUMB or
* WW_LINEAR. It can also conform to the underlying terrain.
*
* Altitudes within the path's positions are interpreted according to the path's altitude mode. If the altitude mode is
* WW_ALTITUDE_MODE_ABSOLUTE, the default, the altitudes are considered as height above the ellipsoid. If the altitude
* mode is WW_ALTITUDE_MODE_RELATIVE_TO_GROUND the altitudes are added to the elevation of the terrain at the position.
* If the altitude mode is WW_ALTITUDE_MODE_CLAMP_TO_GROUND the altitudes are ignored and the path is drawn on the
* terrain at that point.
*
* Between the specified positions the path is drawn along a curve specified by the path's path type, either
* WW_GREAT_CIRCLE, WW_RHUMB or WW_LINEAR. When the path type is WW_LINEAR the path conforms to terrain only if the
* follow-terrain property is true. Otherwise the path positions are connected by straight lines.
*
* The terrain conformance of WW_GREAT_CIRCLE and WW_RHUMB paths is determined by the path's follow-terrain and
* terrain-conformance properties. When the follow-terrain property is YES, the path segments -- the path
* portions between the specified positions -- follow the shape of the terrain, otherwise they do not. When following
* terrain, the terrain-conformance property governs the precision of conformance and the number of intermediate
* positions generated between the specified positions.
*
* If the follow-terrain property is NO, the number of intermediate positions generated between the specified
* positions is specified by the number-of-subsegments property, which defaults to 10 subsegments.
*
* Paths have separate attributes for normal display and highlighted display. If no attributes are specified, default
* attributes are used.
