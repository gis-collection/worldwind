/**
 * BufferUtil provides a collection of static utility methods for working with buffers that are used to submit vertex
 * attribute data and element data to OpenGL.
 * <p/>
 * <strong>Creating OpenGL Buffers</strong>
 * <p/>
 * Vertex attribute data and element data is submitted to OpenGL and OpenGL ES using Java's New I/O Buffers. Since these
 * buffers are used by both the Java virtual machine and the OpenGL driver, they must reference direct system memory and
 * have their elements stored in the platform byte order. BufferUtil provides methods for creating buffers that meet
 * these criteria: newByteBuffer, newShortBuffer, and newFloatBuffer.
 * <p/>
 * World Wind's use of buffers to store vertex attributes and elements is based on the capabilities of OpenGL ES 2.0.
 * The OpenGL ES 2.0 system accepts vertex attributes stored in bytes, shorts, and floats, and accepts elements stored
 * in bytes and shorts. Given these limitations, BufferUtil provides only the methods necessary for working with buffers
 * representing these data types.
