* Provides retrieval and caching of resources. This class is typically used to retrieve image and elevation resources

 * The retrieval is performed on a separate thread from that of the initializer. The finished block is called on the
 * same thread that performRetrieval is called on.
 *
 * Instances of this class can be used directly by calling performRetrieval or as an NSOperation. In the latter case
 * the call to performRetrieval is made on the NSOperation's thread.
