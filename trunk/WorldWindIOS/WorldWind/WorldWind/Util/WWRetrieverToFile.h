/**
* Provides retrieval and caching of resources to a file. This class is typically used to retrieve image and elevation
* resources from the internet and save them to the local World Wind file system cache.
 *
 * When a retrieval is complete, a notification is sent indicating retrieval status. The notification's user info
 * dictionary includes the retrieval status (WW_RETRIEVAL_STATUS) of either WW_SUCCEEDED,
 * WW_FAILED or WW_CANCELED. The dictionary also includes the retriever's URL (WW_URL) and its
 * file path (WW_FILE_PATH).
 *
 * Instances of this class can be used directly by calling performRetrieval or as an NSOperation. In the latter case
 * the call to performRetrieval is made on the NSOperation's thread.
