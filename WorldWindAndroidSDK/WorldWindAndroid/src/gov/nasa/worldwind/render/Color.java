/**
 * Color represents an RGBA color where each component is represented as a floating-point value in the range [0.0, 1.0],
 * where 0.0 indicates zero intensity and 1.0 indicates full intensity. The four components of color are read-write, and
 * are stored as double-precision floating-point values. GpuProgram provides a convenience method {@link
 * GpuProgram#loadUniformColor(String, Color)} for loading a color into an OpenGL ES shader uniform variable as a vec4.
 * <p/>
 * <strong>Mutability</strong>
 * <p/>
 * Color is mutable and provides public read and write access to each of its four components as properties
 * <code>r</code>, <code>g</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>a</code>. Additionally, color provides an overloaded
 * <code>set</code> method for specifying all RGB or RGBA components in bulk. It is important to avoid assumptions that
 * the application can know when a color changes. In particular, rendering code should should be written to
 * automatically display changes to any colors it depends on.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * <strong>Color Space</strong>
 * <p/>
 * Color's four RGBA components are assumed to exist in the standard RGBA color space. Commonly used colors are provided
 * via static methods that return a new color instance who's components are configured to represent the specified RGB
 * color. Since color is mutable the returned instances are unique, and therefore should not be assumed to be constant.
 * <p/>
 * Color makes no attempts to represent a premultiplied RGBA color, but does provide the {@link #premultiply()} method
 * for converting a color from the standard RGBA color space to the premultiplied RGBA color space. color does not track
 * whether an instance has been premultiplied; it is the responsibility of the application to do so.
 * <p/>
 * <strong>Color Int</strong>
 * <p/>
 * A color int refers to an RGB or ARGB color specified by a 32-bit packed int. Each component is represented by an
 * 8-bit value in the range [0, 255] where 0 indicates zero intensity and 255 indicates full intensity. The components
 * are understood to be packed as follows: alpha in bits 24-31, red in bits 16-23, green in bits 8-15, and blue in bits
 * 0-7. This format is compatible with Android's {@link android.graphics.Color} class.
 * <p/>
 * Colors can be converted between floating-point RGBA colors and packed 32-bit color ints, and vice versa. This is done
 * by mapping each 8-bit component in the range [0, 255] to the range [0.0, 1.0].
 * <p/>
 * Converting a component from 8-bit to floating-point is accomplished by dividing the value by 255.
 * <p/>
 * Converting a component from floating-point to 8-bit is accomplished by multiplying the value by 255, adding 0.5, then
 * taking the floor of the result. The additional step of adding 0.5 ensures that rounding errors do not produce values
 * that are too small. For example, if the 8-bit value 1 is converted to floating-point by dividing by 255 then
 * converted back to 8-bit by multiplying by 255, the result is 0. This is because the result of 255 * (1/255) is
 * slightly less than 1, which results in 0 after taking the floor. Adding 0.5 before taking the floor compensates for
 * limitations in floating point precision.
