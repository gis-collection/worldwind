/**
* Provides the elevations to a WWGlobe or other object holding elevations.
*
* An elevation model may store its backing data in memory or may retrieve it on demand from an external source. The
* methods elevationForLatitude:longitude: and minAndMaxElevationsForSector:result: operate on the elevation data
* currently in memory, and therefore are not guaranteed to provide meaningful results until after
* elevationsForSector:numLat:numLon:targetResolution:verticalExaggeration:result: has been called.
*
* An elevation model often approximates elevations at multiple levels of spatial resolution. A target resolution may not
* be immediately achievable, however, because the corresponding elevation data might not be locally available and must
* be retrieved from a remote location.  When this is the case, the value returned by
* elevationsForSector:numLat:numLon:targetResolution:verticalExaggeration:result: identifies the resolution achievable
* with the data currently available. That resolution may not be the same as the target resolution.
