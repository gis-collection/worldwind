/**
* WWBasicTextureProgram is a GLSL program that draws geometry with a texture and solid color. When the texture is
* enabled the final fragment color is determined by multiplying the texture color with the solid color. Otherwise the
* fragment color is that of the solid color. WWBasicTextureProgram exposes the following vertex attributes and uniform
* variables to configure its behavior:
*
* ###Vertex Attributes###
*
* `vec4 vertexPoint` - The geometry's vertex points, in model coordinates. This attribute's location is provided by
* the vertexPointLocation property.
*
* `vec4 vertexTexCoord` - The geometry's vertex texture coordinates. This attribute's location is provided by
* the vertexTexCoordLocation property.
*
* ###Uniform Variables###
*
* `mat4 mvpMatrix` - The modelview-projection matrix used to transform the `vertexPoint` attribute. Specified using
* loadModelviewProjection:.
*
* `mat4 texCoordMatrix` - The matrix used to transform the `vertexTexCoord` attribute. Specified using
* loadTextureMatrix:.
*
* `vec4 color` - The RGBA color used to draw the geometry. Specified using either of loadColor: or loadPickColor:.
*
* `bool enableTexture` - YES to enable texturing; otherwise NO. Specified using loadTextureEnabled:.
*
* `sampler2D textureSampler` - The texture unit the texture is bound to (GL_TEXTURE0, GL_TEXTURE1, GL_TEXTURE2, etc.).
* Specified using loadTextureUnit:.
