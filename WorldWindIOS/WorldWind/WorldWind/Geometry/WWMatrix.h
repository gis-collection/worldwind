* setToPerspectiveProjection:nearDistance:farDistance: or setToScreenProjection:.
*
* The depth offset may be any real number and is typically used to draw geometry slightly closer to the user's eye in
* order to give those shapes visual priority over nearby or geometry. An offset of zero has no effect. An offset less
* than zero brings depth values closer to the eye, while an offset greater than zero pushes depth values away from the
* eye.
*
* Depth offset may be applied to both perspective and orthographic projection matrices. The effect on each projection
* type is outlined here:
*
* *Perspective Projection*
*
* The effect of depth offset on a perspective projection increases exponentially with distance from the eye. This
* has the effect of adjusting the offset for the loss in depth precision with geometry drawn further from the eye.
* Distant geometry requires a greater offset to differentiate itself from nearby geometry, while close geometry does
* not.
*
* *Orthographic Projection*
*
* The effect of depth offset on an orthographic projection increases linearly with distance from the eye. While it is
* reasonable to apply a depth offset to an orthographic projection, the effect is most appropriate when applied to the
* projection used to draw the scene. For example, when an object's coordinates are projected by a perspective projection
* into screen coordinates then drawn using an orthographic projection, it is best to apply the offset to the original
* perspective projection. The method [WWNavigatorState project:result:depthOffset:] performs the correct behavior
* for the projection type used to draw the scene.
