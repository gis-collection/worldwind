/**
* Provides a view with a World Wind virtual globe. This is the top-level World Wind object and the fundamental object
* applications instance and interact with. The view automatically provides on-demand retrieval of imagery, elevations
* and other data, as well as user-initiated navigation and globe manipulation. Using the view is simple: allocate it,
* initialize it and add it to the application's main view or sub-view.
*
* Manipulation of the globe is performed by the user via a Navigator. The default navigator is WWLookAtNavigator,
* which provides a trackball-style interaction model. World Wind also provides a WWFirstPersonNavigator that
* implements a first-person model allowing the user to manipulate a virtual camera. The navigation models can be
* switched by setting the view's navigator property.
*
* The view provides picking support via its pick method. When called, that method determines the shapes and
* terrain-location for a specified pick point, which is typically the point associated with a tap gesture. Applications
* must call the pick method to effect a pick; picking is not performed automatically. Unlike World Wind Java,
* there is no select event mechanism.
*
* Layers can be added to and removed from the World Wind view via the scene controller, available via the
* sceneController property.
*
* When a layer or other aspect of the view is changed, the view must redraw to effect the change on the screen. This
* is performed automatically during navigation and for layer list changes. Applications must explicitly request a
* redraw when they make changes to layer contents, including the shapes in a WWRenderableLayer. Redraws can be
* requested either by calling the World Wind view's requestRedraw method or by sending a WW_REQUEST_REDRAW notification
* to the default notification center. See the implementation of WorldWindView.requestRedraw for an example of how to
* form and send the notification. The benefit of the notification approach is that the application object requesting
* the redraw need not have a reference to the WorldWindView object.
